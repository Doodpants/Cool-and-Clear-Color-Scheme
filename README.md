Cool & Clear is...

#### Tastefully Minimal

Many color schemes use a large variety of colors for various syntactic and semantic
elements, resulting in code listings that look quite festive, but which do not necessarily
aid comprehension. Cool & Clear keeps it simple by using only a few different colors:

- Green for comments
- Blue for language keywords
- Purple for literals, such as strings and numbers
- Red-on-red for syntax errors (which in practice will rarely be seen)
- Black for everything else

#### High Contrast

Many color schemes use text colors that do not contrast well with the background,
especially for comments. Some schemes go so far as to make comments nearly invisible!
Cool & Clear keeps code easy to read by using full white for the background, and
sufficiently dark colors for text.

#### Light-Mode

There seem to be more light-on-dark color schemes available than the reverse.
But I prefer to work with dark text on a light background.

Cool & Clear is...

#### Tastefully Minimal

Many color schemes use a large variety of colors for various syntactic and semantic
elements, resulting in code listings that look quite festive, but which do not necessarily
aid comprehension. Cool & Clear keeps it simple by using only a few different
colors:

- <span style="color: #075; font-family: monospace;">Green</span> for comments
- <span style="color: #00E; font-family: monospace;">Blue</span> for language keywords
- <span style="color: #80C; font-family: monospace;">Purple</span> for literals, such as
    strings and numbers
- <span style="color: #E00; background-color: #FDD; font-family: monospace;">Red-on-red</span>
    for syntax errors (which in practice will rarely be seen)
- <span style="color: #000; font-family: monospace;">Black</span> for everything else

#### High Contrast

Many color schemes use text colors that do not contrast well with the background,
especially for comments. Some schemes go so far as to make comments nearly invisible!
Cool & Clear keeps code easy to read by using full white for the background, and
sufficiently dark colors for text.

#### Light-Mode

There seem to be many more light-on-dark color schemes in the wild than the reverse.
Perhaps many programmers prefer to work this way, but I do not.
